# Radial Menu

## About the App
This was a programming challenge I did in 2015 for a job interview. It is simply an iPad context menu with some non-trivial graphical elements. Doesn't actually do anything, but is meant to look nice and engage the user.

Click and hold to see your navigate-to options as a radial menu. Mouse over one of the options to navigate to that page. There is some bouncing, some color changes and some size transformations. This was simply meant as an exersize in UIAnimate and to see my coding style (as of 2015, when I did the exersize!)
